# Goblin Warlord Simulator


This is a very simple app that allows you to raise a goblin army. Eventually. 
We built this primarily with monetization as the top focus for the first build to ensure that the Play Store doesn't kick-back based off of ads.

Alpha Version Release:

- Click on the house, deal damage, earn some gold for your stash from the damage you deal
- Get gold in your stash faster by watching ads. 2 modes supported (swiping banners and watching videos)
- Very basic UI. We lack designs and wireframes. This is more of a pure functional build
- Graphics are all open source / pulled from google images with the permission to modify / use freely
